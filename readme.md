# IBM Business Automation - Decision Manager Open Edition - Demo Parent for Kogito

This repository contains the master Maven parent project object model (POM) for all demos related to IBM Decision Manager Open Edition that rely on Kogito dependencies.

## Overview

The purpose of the demo parent POM is to provide a single Maven project that manages the group of dependencies for all Decison Manager Open Edition projects that rely on Kogito dependencies.  The demo parent POM is divided into several sections, listed as follows:

### Properties Section

In a Maven pom file you have the ability to manage properties used throughout the build process.  Properties are inherited at the pom level, so any pom that uses a pom as a `parent` will inherit these property values.  

``` xml
	<!-- Project Properties -->
	<properties>
		<!-- General Properties -->
		<project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
		<project.reporting.outputEncoding>UTF-8</project.reporting.outputEncoding>

		<!-- Java Properties -->
		<java.version>11</java.version>

		<!-- Common Maven Plugins -->
		<maven.compiler.source>${java.version}</maven.compiler.source>
		<maven.compiler.target>${java.version}</maven.compiler.target>
		<maven.compiler.plugin.version>3.8.1</maven.compiler.plugin.version>
		<maven.compiler.parameters>true</maven.compiler.parameters>
		<maven.resources.plugin.version>3.2.0</maven.resources.plugin.version>
		<maven.shade.plugin.version>3.2.4</maven.shade.plugin.version>
		<maven.surefire.plugin.version>3.0.0-M5</maven.surefire.plugin.version>

		<!-- Quarkus Dependencies -->
		<quarkus.group.id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.group.id>
		<quarkus.artifact.id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.artifact.id>
		<quarkus.version>2.7.3.Final</quarkus.version>

		<!-- Kogito Dependencies -->
		<kogito.group.id>org.kie.kogito</kogito.group.id>
		<kogito.artifact.id>kogito-quarkus-bom</kogito.artifact.id>
		<kogito.version>1.18.0.Final</kogito.version>

		<!-- Testing Properties -->
		<junit.version>4.13.2</junit.version>
		<skipTests>true</skipTests>

		<!-- Logging Dependencies -->
		<slf4j.version>1.7.32</slf4j.version>
		<logback.version>1.2.10</logback.version>
	</properties>
```

### Distribution Management Section

This section allows the user to configure where built artifacts are delivered to.  In Maven, there are two types of build targets, `install` and `deploy`.  The `install` target deliveres the resulting built packages to the user's local `.m2/repository` location, configured by the user's `settings.xml` file, located either in the user's `.m2` location or in the `/conf` folder of the Maven installation directory.  The `deploy` target uses the location specified in the `distributionManagement` section to deliver the resulting packages into the enterprise Maven (Artifactory) repository.

``` xml
	<!-- Enterprise Artifact Repository -->
	<distributionManagement>
		<repository>
			<id>${repository.id}</id>
			<name>${repository.name}</name>
			<url>${repository.url}</url>
		</repository>
	</distributionManagement>
```

Then on the server side add the following code gist to the `settings.xml` file wherever your enterprise repository is configured:

``` xml
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>${repository.id}</id>
			<username>${user}</username>
			<password>${password}</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
```

Notice how the **id** tag in the **server** config in `settings.xml` lines up the **id** tag in the **repository** config of the `pom.xml` file!

## How To Build

This repository is built using `mvn clean install` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  As the master POM for all demo projects, this repository must be the first repository built and installed into Maven.

## How To Deploy

This repository is built using `mvn clean deploy` by either the CI/CD pipeline or on a local developer workstation.  As the master POM for all demo projects, this repository must be the first repository built and deployed to enterprise Maven (Artifactory).

## Additional Information (*Appendicies*)
This repository is focused on business automation using **IBM Decison Manager Open Edition** products, which in turn rely on various open source tools and technology. The following online documentation is available in order to learn various aspects of these tools:

- [**Apache Maven**](https://maven.apache.org/) is a free and open source software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a projectâ€™s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of  information. A **getting started guide** is available [here](http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com//) is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. There is a **handbook** available [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/), as well as various **guides** for learning and working with Git available [here](https://guides.github.com/
- [**Quarkus**](https://quarkus.io) Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world. Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application architectures.
- [**Kogito**](https://kogito.kie.org) Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure. If you think about business automation think about the cloud as this is where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
